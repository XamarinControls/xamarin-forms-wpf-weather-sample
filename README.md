## Xamarin.Forms App 

[Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms) allows you to build native UIs for iOS, Android, **Windows**, macOS and Linux from a single, shared codebase. You can dive into mobile development with Xamarin.Forms by following our [free self-guided learning](https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/self-guided) from Xamarin University. This project exercises the following patterns and features:

  * [MVVM](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data_bindings_to_mvvm/)
  * [Styles](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/styles/)
